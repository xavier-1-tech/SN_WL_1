# ServiceNow Incident Priority Notification Workflow - Assignment Submission

**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Course:** ServiceNow Development  
**Assignment:** Kura Workload 1 - Fix Incident Notification Workflow

## Assignment Overview

I was tasked with fixing a broken ServiceNow workflow that should automatically send email notifications when critical network incidents are created. The workflow was triggering on the wrong priority level and needed to be corrected to match the target specification.

## Problem Analysis

After analyzing the current state versus the target implementation, I identified the key issue:

**Current Issue:** The flow was configured to trigger on `priority=5` (Planning) instead of `priority=1` (Critical)  
**Required Fix:** Update the trigger condition to activate on critical priority incidents only

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Process
The incident creation process starts with users filling out the standard ServiceNow incident form. When they:
- Select **Category**: "Network" 
- Set **Priority**: "1 - Critical"
- Submit the form

This should automatically trigger our notification workflow to alert the Network Operations team.

### 2. Backend Process (Workflow)
I worked with the **"Kura WL1"** flow in Flow Designer to implement the following logic:

**Flow Structure:**
1. **Trigger**: "Record Created" on incident table
2. **Condition Check**: IF `category = network` AND `priority = 1` (Critical)
3. **Action**: "Send Notification" to Network Operations group

**Key Changes Made:**
- Modified the trigger condition from `priority=5` to `priority=1` 
- Verified the notification action was properly configured
- Ensured the flow was activated and published
- Tested the conditional logic to confirm proper execution

### 3. Relevant Database Tables

During this assignment, I worked with several key ServiceNow tables:

- **`incident`** - Stores the incident records with category and priority fields
- **`sys_hub_flow`** - Contains the Flow Designer workflow definition  
- **`sys_email`** - Generated email notification records
- **`sys_user_group`** - User group configurations including Network Operations
- **`sysevent_email_action`** - Email notification templates and settings

### 4. Network Operations User Group Configuration

I ensured the Network Operations group was properly configured:
- **Group Name**: "Network Operations"
- **Table**: `sys_user_group`
- **Status**: Active
- **Purpose**: Receives critical network incident notifications

This group serves as the target recipient for all automated notifications generated by the workflow.

### 5. Optimization (Agentic Capabilities)

To make this workflow more intelligent and autonomous, I propose these enhancements:

- **Auto-Classification**: Use NLP to automatically categorize incidents based on description keywords
- **Smart Priority Detection**: Implement sentiment analysis to auto-assign priority levels based on urgency indicators  
- **Predictive Routing**: Route incidents to team members based on expertise patterns and current workload
- **Knowledge Integration**: Connect to knowledge base for auto-suggesting solutions to common network issues

These could be implemented using ServiceNow's Predictive Intelligence platform and Flow Designer REST integrations.
